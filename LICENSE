EDUCATIONAL USE NOTICE:

This project is created for educational purposes to demonstrate seccomp 
(secure computing mode) functionality in Linux systems. It includes examples 
of system call filtering, sandboxing techniques, and security implementations.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK:
- This software is provided for learning and research purposes
- Seccomp filters can terminate processes if not properly configured
- Always test in safe environments before production use
- The authors are not responsible for any damage caused by misuse

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
- Seccomp filters are security-critical components
- Improper implementation may create security vulnerabilities
- Always validate filters thoroughly before deployment
- Consider all syscall dependencies in your applications

For production use, please:
1. Conduct thorough security reviews
2. Test with realistic workloads
3. Consider using established libraries like libseccomp
4. Follow security best practices and guidelines
